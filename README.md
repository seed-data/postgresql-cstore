# PostgreSQL with cstore_fdw

Citus is a PostgreSQL-based distributed RDBMS. For more information, see the [Citus Data website][citus data].

## Function

This image provides a single running Citus instance (atop PostgreSQL 9.5), using standard configuration values. It is based on [the official PostgreSQL image][docker-postgres], so be sure to consult that image’s documentation for advanced configuration options (including non-default settings for e.g. `PGDATA` or `POSTGRES_USER`).

Just like the standard PostgreSQL image, this image exposes port `5432`. In other words, all containers on the same Docker network should be able to connect on this port, and exposing it externally will permit connections from external clients (`psql`, adapters, applications).

## Usage

Since Citus is intended for use within a cluster, there are many ways to deploy it. This repository provides configuration to permit three kinds of deployment: local (standalone), local (with workers), and cloud-based (with workers).

### Standalone Use

If you just want to run a single Citus instance, it’s pretty easy to get started:

```bash
docker run --name citus_standalone -p 5432:5432 citusdata/citus
```

If you’re using `docker-machine`, you might want to run `docker-machine ip` to determine the host to connect to. Otherwise, you should be able to connect to `127.0.0.1` on port `5432` using e.g. `psql` to run a few commands (see the Citus documentation for more information).

As with the PostgreSQL image, the default `PGDATA` directory will be mounted as a volume, so it will persist between restarts of the container. But while the above _will_ get you a running Citus instance, it won’t have any workers to exercise distributed query planning. For that, you may wish to try the included [`docker-compose.yml`][compose-config] configuration.

#### Nightly Image

In addition to the `latest` (release) tag and the major-, minor-, and patch-specific tags, the `Dockerfile` in the `nightly` directory builds a tagged image with the latest Citus nightly (from the Citus `master` branch).

### Docker Compose

The included `docker-compose.yml` file provides an easy way to get started with a Citus cluster, complete with multiple workers. Just copy it to your current directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose -p citus up

# Creating network "citus_default" with the default driver
# Creating citus_worker_1
# Creating citus_master
# Creating citus_config
# Attaching to citus_worker_1, citus_master, citus_config
# worker_1    | The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
# worker_1    | This user must also own the server process.
# ...
```

That’s it! As with the standalone mode, you’ll want to find your `docker-machine ip` if you’re using that technology, otherwise, just connect locally to `5432`. By default, you’ll only have one worker:

```sql
SELECT master_get_active_worker_nodes();

--  master_get_active_worker_nodes
-- --------------------------------
--  (citus_worker_1,5432)
-- (1 row)
```

But you can add more workers at will using `docker-compose scale` in another tab. For instance, to bring your worker count to five…

```bash
docker-compose -p citus scale worker=5

# Creating and starting 2 ... done
# Creating and starting 3 ... done
# Creating and starting 4 ... done
# Creating and starting 5 ... done
```

```sql
SELECT master_get_active_worker_nodes();

--  master_get_active_worker_nodes
-- --------------------------------
--  (citus_worker_5,5432)
--  (citus_worker_1,5432)
--  (citus_worker_3,5432)
--  (citus_worker_2,5432)
--  (citus_worker_4,5432)
-- (5 rows)
```

If you inspect the configuration file, you’ll find that there is a container that is neither a master nor worker node: `citus_config`. It simply listens for new containers tagged with the worker role, then adds them to the config file in a volume shared with the master node. If new nodes have appeared, it calls `master_initialize_node_metadata` against the master to repopulate the node table. See Citus’ [`workerlist-gen`][workerlist-gen] repo for more details.

You can stop your cluster with `docker-compose -p citus down`.

### Docker Cloud

Now the real fun starts!

As the Docker Cloud UI is mostly self-explanatory, we’ll cover getting a Citus cluster running via the `docker-cloud` CLI. First, we’ll need some node clusters. The master cluster will have one node and the worker cluster will have two:

```bash
docker-cloud nodecluster create --tag master citus_master_node digitalocean nyc1 2gb
docker-cloud nodecluster create --tag worker -t2 citus_worker_nodes digitalocean nyc1 1gb
```

Surprisingly, this is all the setup needed to deploy our stack. All that’s left is to start it. Ensure the `tutum.yml` file is in the current directory, then run:

```bash
docker-cloud stack up -n citus-cloud
```

After the stack has started, we can view its endpoints:

```bash
docker-cloud service ps --stack citus-cloud
# NAME    UUID      STATUS       #CONTAINERS  IMAGE                                        DEPLOYED       PUBLIC DNS                                    STACK
# worker  example  ▶ Running              2  citusdata/citus:latest                       2 minutes ago  worker.citus-cloud.examples.svc.dockerapp.io  citus-cloud
# master  example  ▶ Running              1  citusdata/citus:latest                       2 minutes ago  master.citus-cloud.examples.svc.dockerapp.io  citus-cloud
# config  example  ▶ Running              1  citusdata/dockercloud-workerlist-gen:latest  1 minute ago   config.citus-cloud.examples.svc.dockerapp.io  citus-cloud
```

The master node should be reachable at its public address on port `5432`. One last thing… as with Compose, you can even scale your worker service to add more containers: `docker-cloud service scale worker.citus-cloud 5`. They’ll show up in the master’s worker list file as soon as they’re available (this functionality provided by [`dockercloud-workerlist-gen`][dockercloud-workerlist-gen]).

You can stop your stack with `docker-cloud stack terminate citus-cloud`.
